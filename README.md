# KMeans-Image-Segmentation
Implementation of K-Means Clustering for Image Segmentation

This package implements K-Means clustering in Python3 & also contains a module which utilizes the k-means implementation to perform image segmentation. 

To run, place input files in images/inputs and update config.json with desired image path and other k means parameters.

## Installation:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running:
To run this project:
